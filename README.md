# üëã Hi, I'm Shaurya!

A seasoned Software Engineer with deep experience in foundational and leadership roles across fast-scaling startups and transformative technology companies. As a founding engineer and later Tech Lead at Apna, I architected and scaled a platform that revolutionized the job market for millions of blue-collar workers in India, significantly enhancing system functionality and user experiences.

At Amagi, I developed Ruby on Rails and Python code for Cloudport, optimizing AWS services to reduce costs and improve global streaming services. At Privyr, I managed a sophisticated cloud infrastructure utilizing AWS and GCP, leading coding initiatives and architectural developments that boosted platform capabilities in alignment with strategic goals.

In addition to my technical contributions, I led engineering teams, guiding strategic project execution and fostering a culture of innovation and efficiency. I also built and nurtured a gaming community, GsocTV, engaging over 20,000 gamers through competitive and interactive platforms.

My expertise spans backend development, system architecture, and full-stack development, with a strong focus on project management and strategic planning. I am driven to develop scalable technology solutions that advance industries and simplify lives. Let's connect and explore potential collaborations for technological advancement.

üî≠ I‚Äôve worked on projects that have reached millions, and I specialize in Python, Django, Javascript, GCP, AWS, Go, and Kubernetes.
